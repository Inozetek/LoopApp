## üí° Testing Tips

**For Best Results:**
- Take your time (don't rush)
- Test on multiple devices if possible
- Use real data (real friends, real activities)
- Try to break things (edge cases)
- Document everything (screenshots help)
- Think like a user (not a developer)

**Common Issues to Watch For:**
- Text overflow in small spaces
- Touch targets too small (<44pt)
- Loading states missing
- Error messages unclear
- Haptic feedback missing
- Dark mode text not readable
- Images not loading
- Slow animations
