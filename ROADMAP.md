- [ ] **Research:** What's the right price point for Plus ($4.99 vs $2.99 vs $7.99)?

### Product Features
- [ ] **Decision:** Should we support group sizes >5 people in MVP? (Or cap at 5)
- [ ] **Decision:** Should we show user profile pictures in friends list? (Privacy concern)
- [ ] **Research:** Do users want a "Surprise me" button for random suggestions?

### Algorithm Design
- [ ] **Decision:** How much weight should "distance" have vs "interest match"?
- [ ] **Decision:** Should we show sponsored activities if they score <40 base points?
- [ ] **Experiment:** Does showing AI explanation increase acceptance rate?

### Technical Architecture
- [ ] **Decision:** Should we use Expo EAS (paid) or build locally? (Cost vs convenience)
- [ ] **Decision:** Python microservice for ML or keep it in Node.js backend?
- [ ] **Decision:** Redis hosting: Upstash (serverless) or Redis Cloud (dedicated)?
