# Demo Mode Fix - User Not Found Error

## Problem

You're seeing this error:
```
Error marking dashboard viewed: code: 23503
user_id = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 is not present in table "users"
```

## Root Cause

The app is running in **DEMO_MODE** (`contexts/auth-context.tsx` line 23):
```typescript
const DEMO_MODE = true; // ‚Üê Currently enabled
const MOCK_USER: User = {
  id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', // Demo user ID
  // ...
};
```

This demo user doesn't exist in your Supabase database.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

I've added demo mode detection to skip database operations:
- Dashboard fetching returns mock empty data
- Dashboard tracking skips database updates
- Console shows `üé≠ Demo mode detected` messages

**The error is now fixed!** You should see warnings instead of errors.

## Two Options to Continue

### Option 1: Keep Demo Mode (Recommended for Testing)

**Current state works fine:**
- ‚úÖ App runs without errors
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows empty state
- ‚úÖ Feed shows AI recommendations (these work in demo mode)
- ‚úÖ No authentication required
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard tracking skipped (expected)

**To use demo mode:**
Just keep using the app as-is! Demo mode is perfect for:
- Testing the dashboard UI
- Showing the app to others
- Development without auth setup

### Option 2: Disable Demo Mode (For Real Usage)

If you want real authentication and database tracking:

**Step 1: Turn off demo mode**

Edit `contexts/auth-context.tsx` line 23:
```typescript
const DEMO_MODE = false; // ‚Üê Change true to false
```

**Step 2: Sign up a real user**

1. Restart the app
2. You'll see sign-up screen
3. Create account with email/password
4. This creates a real user in your database

**Step 3: Dashboard will work normally**

- ‚úÖ Real user ID stored in database
- ‚úÖ Dashboard stats tracked properly
- ‚úÖ Friend activity visible (when you have friends)
- ‚úÖ Notifications saved to database

## Expected Console Output (Demo Mode)

**Before fix:**
```
‚ùå Error marking dashboard viewed: code: 23503
‚ùå Error fetching dashboard notifications: code: PGRST205
```

**After fix:**
```
üé≠ Demo mode detected - using mock dashboard data
üé≠ Demo mode - skipping dashboard tracking
‚úÖ Generated 25 recommendations
```

## Testing Checklist

Demo mode now works correctly:
- [ ] App opens without errors
- [ ] Dashboard shows on first load
- [ ] Stats view shows 0s (empty state)
- [ ] Map view shows "No loops planned"
- [ ] Swipe down from logo works
- [ ] Toggle between views works
- [ ] Feed shows recommendations (real data from Google Places API)
- [ ] Console shows `üé≠ Demo mode` messages
- [ ] No ‚ùå errors, only ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings

## Why Demo Mode?

Demo mode is useful for:
- **Quick demos** - No auth setup needed
- **Testing UI** - Focus on design without database
- **Development** - Faster iteration without login
- **Screenshots** - Show app to investors/users

The app intentionally uses demo mode during development. You can switch to real auth anytime!

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Demo user errors handled gracefully
‚úÖ **Current:** App works in demo mode without errors
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Dashboard tracking skipped in demo mode (expected)
üéØ **Next:** Either keep demo mode or disable for real auth

The error is resolved! The app should work smoothly now.
