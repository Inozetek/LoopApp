# üß† Intelligent Recommendations - Complete

**Status:** ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete - Scoring visible, Data-dense cards
**Next:** üìÖ Calendar integration for context-aware recommendations

---

## ‚úÖ What We Built

### 1. **Intelligent Card Design**
Replaced image-heavy cards with **data-dense, transparent recommendations**:

**New Card Shows:**
- **Match Score (0-100)**: Big badge showing confidence
  - 80-100 = Green (excellent match)
  - 60-79 = Blue (good match)
  - 40-59 = Orange (okay match)
  - 0-39 = Red (poor match)
- **Why Loop Recommends**: Clear bullet points explaining the logic
- **Score Breakdown**: Visual bar chart showing:
  - Interest match (0-40 pts)
  - Location score (0-20 pts)
  - Timing score (0-15 pts)
  - Feedback history (0-15 pts)
- **Key Metadata**: Rating, price, distance prominently displayed
- **Category badge**: Clear categorization

**What Changed:**
- ‚ùå Removed: Huge images taking up 1.25x screen height
- ‚úÖ Added: Transparent scoring that users can understand
- ‚úÖ Added: "Why we recommend this" section
- ‚úÖ Added: Score breakdown visualization

### 2. **Scoring System (Already Built)**
The recommendation engine (`services/recommendation-engine.ts`) calculates:

```typescript
Base Score (0-40 points):
- Top 3 interests: 40 pts
- Any interest: 30 pts
- Related category: 20 pts
- No match: 10 pts

Location Score (0-20 points):
- On commute route (<0.5 mi): 20 pts
- Near home/work (<1 mi): 15 pts
- Within max distance: 10-15 pts
- Far away: 5 pts

Time Score (0-15 points):
- Perfect timing (coffee at 8am): 15 pts
- Good timing (lunch at 12pm): 10 pts
- Acceptable: 5-8 pts

Feedback Score (0-15 points):
- Liked similar places: 15 pts
- Liked similar price: 10 pts
- No history: 5 pts

Collaborative (0-10 points):
- Similar users liked: 10 pts
- Some overlap: 5 pts
```

**Total: 0-100 points** (before sponsor boost)

### 3. **Learning Indicator**
As users engage with Loop:
1. **Feedback builds history** ‚Üí Feedback score improves
2. **More data collected** ‚Üí Location/time scores get smarter
3. **Score increases over time** ‚Üí Users see Loop is learning

**User Trust Loop:**
```
Low scores initially (40-60)
  ‚Üì
User accepts recommendations
  ‚Üì
Feedback collected (thumbs up/down)
  ‚Üì
Algorithm learns preferences
  ‚Üì
Scores improve (70-85)
  ‚Üì
User trusts Loop more
  ‚Üì
Uses Loop more frequently
```

## üöß What's Missing: Calendar Integration

### **The Problem**
Currently, recommendations are **not context-aware**:
- ‚ùå We don't know when users are free
- ‚ùå We can't suggest "on your way home from work"
- ‚ùå No "you have 2 hours free at 3pm" prompts
- ‚ùå Score doesn't factor in convenience to current plans

### **The Solution: Calendar Integration**

#### **Phase 1: Calendar Permission Flow**
1. **Onboarding prompt:**
   ```
   "Connect your calendar so Loop can find your free time"
   [Google Calendar] [Apple Calendar] [Skip]
   ```

2. **Request OAuth permissions:**
   - Google Calendar API: Read-only access
   - Apple Calendar: Local calendar read access

3. **Import events:**
   ```typescript
   // services/calendar-service.ts
   export async function syncGoogleCalendar(userId: string) {
     const events = await fetchGoogleCalendarEvents();
     // Import events with location data
     await importEventsToSupabase(userId, events);
   }
   ```

#### **Phase 2: Free Time Detection**
Parse calendar to identify gaps:

```typescript
export function detectFreeTime(events: CalendarEvent[]): FreeTimeSlot[] {
  const freeSlots = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < events.length - 1; i++) {
    const gap = events[i + 1].start_time - events[i].end_time;

    // Free time = gap >= 1 hour
    if (gap >= 60 * 60 * 1000) {
      freeSlots.push({
        start: events[i].end_time,
        end: events[i + 1].start_time,
        duration: gap,
        nearLocation: events[i].location, // Convenient to this
      });
    }
  }

  return freeSlots;
}
```

#### **Phase 3: Context-Aware Scoring**
Add new scoring factors:

```typescript
Convenience Score (0-25 points):
- During free time: 25 pts
- 30 min before/after event: 20 pts
- On route to next event: 15 pts
- Random time: 5 pts

Example:
User has meeting at 123 Main St at 3pm
Restaurant at 125 Main St suggested for 1:30pm
Score = 20 pts (convenient lunch before meeting)
```

**Updated Total: 0-125 points** (normalized to 0-100 for display)

#### **Phase 4: Proactive Notifications**
```
"You have 2 hours free tomorrow at 3pm.
Want activity suggestions?"
[Yes, show me] [No thanks]
```

## üìä What Data We Have from OSM/Google Places

### **OpenStreetMap (Current - Free Tier)**
```typescript
Available Data:
‚úÖ Name, location (lat/lng), address
‚úÖ Category (amenity, leisure, tourism tags)
‚úÖ Hours of operation
‚úÖ Phone, website
‚ùå No photos
‚ùå No user ratings/reviews
‚ùå No real-time data (busy times, wait times)
```

### **Google Places API (Paid Tier)**
```typescript
Available Data:
‚úÖ All OSM data +
‚úÖ High-quality photos
‚úÖ User ratings + review count
‚úÖ Popular times (hourly busy-ness)
‚úÖ Current wait time
‚úÖ Price level
‚úÖ Real-time open/closed status
‚úÖ User reviews (sentiment analysis potential)
```

### **What We Should Add**
1. **Photos (Google Places only)**:
   - Show 1 small thumbnail (not full-screen)
   - Purpose: Visual confirmation, not primary content

2. **Busy times**:
   - "Usually quiet at this time" vs "Peak hours"
   - Add to score: Quiet = +5 pts

3. **User reviews (GPT analysis)**:
   - Analyze reviews for: "romantic", "family-friendly", "loud"
   - Match to user context

## üìà Expected Impact

### **User Trust:**
- **Before:** "Loop shows random restaurants with pretty pictures"
- **After:** "Loop understands my schedule and shows me activities when I'm free, with transparent reasoning"

### **Engagement:**
- **Before:** 15-20% recommendation acceptance rate
- **After:** 35-45% acceptance (visible scoring builds trust)

### **Retention:**
- **Before:** Users try once, don't return
- **After:** Users return daily to check "What should I do during my free time?"

### **Viral Growth:**
- Users tell friends: "Loop actually knows my schedule and finds things I'd never discover"
- Calendar integration = harder to switch to competitor

## üß™ A/B Test Ideas

### **Test 1: Score Visibility**
- **Control:** Hide score, show only "Why we recommend"
- **Variant:** Show score prominently
- **Measure:** Acceptance rate, time to decision

### **Test 2: Score Threshold**
- **Control:** Show all recommendations (even low scores)
- **Variant:** Only show 60+ scores
- **Measure:** Acceptance rate, user satisfaction

### **Test 3: Score Breakdown**
- **Control:** Show only final score
- **Variant:** Show detailed breakdown
- **Measure:** User trust (survey), engagement

## üí° Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)

### **1. "Craft Your Perfect Day" Mode**
```
User: "I have Saturday free, 10am-6pm"
Loop: "Here's your perfect day..."
  10am: Coffee at Blue Bottle (92 match)
  11:30am: Walk in Golden Gate Park (88 match)
  1pm: Lunch at Tartine (94 match)
  3pm: SFMOMA exhibit (91 match)
  5:30pm: Drinks at Top of the Mark (85 match)
Total time: 7.5 hours, Budget: $$
[Accept All] [Customize]
```

### **2. Social Context Scoring**
```
If friend is nearby:
  "Sarah is 0.5 mi away. Want to meet for coffee?"
  Score +20 pts (social convenience)
```

### **3. Weather Integration**
```
If raining:
  Outdoor activities: -15 pts
  Indoor activities: +10 pts
```

### **4. Real-Time Adaptation**
```
User skips gym:
  Show alternative: "Quick workout at home?"
User goes to bar twice this week:
  Increase nightlife category score
```
