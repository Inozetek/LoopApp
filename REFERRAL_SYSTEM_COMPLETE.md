**Example Referral Flow in Database:**
```sql
-- User A signs up ‚Üí gets code "ABC123"
-- User B signs up with code "ABC123"
SELECT process_referral('user_b_id', 'ABC123', 'sms');

## üîß Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration** (5 minutes)

```bash
# Connect to Supabase
psql -h <your-supabase-url> -U postgres -d postgres

# Run migration
\i database/migrations/009_referral_system.sql

# Verify tables created
\dt referrals
\dt referral_rewards

# Test SQL functions
SELECT generate_referral_code();  -- Should return a unique 6-char code
```

**Expected output:**
```
 generate_referral_code
------------------------
 ABC123
(1 row)
```

---

### **Step 2: Test Referral Flow** (10 minutes)

#### **Test 1: Generate Referral Code**

1. Sign up a new user (User A)
2. Complete onboarding
3. Go to Profile Settings
4. See "Invite Friends & Earn Rewards" section
5. Referral code should be auto-generated (e.g., "XYZ789")

**Verify in Database:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, referral_code, referral_count
FROM users
WHERE email = 'usera@example.com';
```

Expected:
```
 id  | name    | referral_code | referral_count
-----+---------+---------------+----------------
 ... | User A  | XYZ789       | 0
```

---

#### **Test 2: Sign Up with Referral Code**

1. Sign out
2. Create new account (User B)
3. Enter referral code "XYZ789" in signup form
4. Complete onboarding
5. See success alert: "üéâ Welcome Bonus! You received 7 days of Loop Plus free!"

**Verify in Database:**
```sql
-- Check referral relationship
SELECT * FROM referrals WHERE referral_code = 'XYZ789';

-- Check rewards granted
SELECT user_id, reward_description, reward_plus_days, status
FROM referral_rewards
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Expected:
```
Referrals:
 referrer_user_id | referred_user_id | status
------------------+------------------+-----------
 user_a_id        | user_b_id        | completed

Rewards:
 user_id    | reward_description                | reward_plus_days | status
------------+-----------------------------------+------------------+--------
 user_b_id  | Welcome bonus: 7 days Loop Plus   | 7                | granted
```

---

#### **Test 3: Milestone Reward (Invite 3 Friends)**

1. Sign up User C with code "XYZ789"
2. Sign up User D with code "XYZ789"
3. Check User A's rewards

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM referral_rewards WHERE user_id = 'user_a_id';
```

Expected (after 3rd referral):
```
reward_description                     | reward_plus_days | status
---------------------------------------+------------------+--------
Invited 3 friends! 1 month Loop Plus  | 30               | granted
```

---

### **Step 3: Deep Linking Setup** (Optional - 30 minutes)

**For Production:** Configure deep links so URLs like `https://loopapp.com/join/ABC123` open the app.

**iOS (app.json):**
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "associatedDomains": ["applinks:loopapp.com"]
    },
    "scheme": "loopapp"
  }
}
```

**Android (app.json):**
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "intentFilters": [
        {
          "action": "VIEW",
          "data": [
            {
              "scheme": "https",
              "host": "loopapp.com",
              "pathPrefix": "/join"
            }
          ],
          "category": ["BROWSABLE", "DEFAULT"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Handle Deep Link in App:**

Create `app/join/[code].tsx`:
```typescript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useLocalSearchParams, router } from 'expo-router';

export default function JoinScreen() {
  const { code } = useLocalSearchParams<{ code: string }>();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Redirect to signup with prefilled code
    if (code) {
      router.replace({
        pathname: '/auth/signup',
        params: { referralCode: code },
      });
    }
  }, [code]);

  return null;
}
```

**Test:**
```
https://loopapp.com/join/ABC123 ‚Üí Opens app ‚Üí Signup with code prefilled
```

## üìä Analytics & Tracking

### **Key Metrics to Monitor:**

**User Metrics:**
- K-factor (viral coefficient): Target >0.7
- Referral conversion rate: Target >30%
- Time to first referral: Target <7 days

**Channel Attribution:**
```sql
SELECT
  source,
  COUNT(*) as referrals,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed
FROM referrals
GROUP BY source
ORDER BY completed DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
 source     | referrals | completed
------------+-----------+-----------
 whatsapp   | 45        | 38
 sms        | 32        | 28
 instagram  | 18        | 12
 link       | 10        | 8
```

**Milestone Progress:**
```sql
SELECT
  u.name,
  u.referral_count,
  COUNT(rr.*) as rewards_earned,
  SUM(rr.reward_plus_days) as total_plus_days
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN referral_rewards rr ON rr.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.referral_count > 0
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.referral_count
ORDER BY u.referral_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üéØ Growth Projections

### **Viral Coefficient Calculation:**

**Assumptions:**
- 50% of users see referral feature
- 30% of those share with 3 friends
- 40% of invited friends sign up

**K-factor = 0.5 √ó 0.3 √ó 3 √ó 0.4 = 0.18**

**Initial K-factor is LOW (need to optimize).**

### **Optimization Strategies:**

**1. Increase Share Rate (30% ‚Üí 60%):**
- Add in-app prompts: "Invite friends to unlock feature X"
- Show leaderboard: "Top referrers this week"
- Push notification: "2 more invites to get 1 month free!"

**2. Increase Conversion Rate (40% ‚Üí 60%):**
- Better landing page for `/join/{code}`
- Show inviter's name: "John invited you to Loop!"
- Highlight welcome bonus more prominently

**3. Increase Friends Invited Per User (3 ‚Üí 5):**
- Group planning naturally drives this
- "Invite your whole crew" messaging

**New K-factor = 0.5 √ó 0.6 √ó 5 √ó 0.6 = 0.9**

**At K=0.9:**
- Month 1: 1,000 users ‚Üí 900 new users ‚Üí 1,900 total
- Month 2: 1,900 √ó 0.9 = 1,710 new ‚Üí 3,610 total
- Month 3: 3,610 √ó 0.9 = 3,249 new ‚Üí 6,859 total
- Month 6: **~50,000 users** (organic!)
