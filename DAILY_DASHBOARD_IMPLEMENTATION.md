# Daily Dashboard Feature - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** Fully Implemented & Integrated

---

## üéØ Feature Overview

The Daily Dashboard is a comprehensive notification hub and stats center that shows users "What's happening around you today". It serves dual purposes:
1. **First-load greeting** - Full-screen modal on first app open each day
2. **Persistent hub** - Accessible via swipe-down gesture from Loop logo anytime

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

### 1. Database Infrastructure
**File:** `database/migrations/004_add_dashboard_and_privacy_groups.sql`

**New Tables:**
- `user_sessions` - Tracks first-load detection per day
- `dashboard_notifications` - Stores personalized notifications (invites, friend activity, etc.)
- `friend_activity_log` - Logs friend activities for "X friends on loops" stats
- `dashboard_stats_cache` - Performance cache for dashboard data

**Extended Schema:**
- Users' `privacy_settings` JSONB now includes:
  - `friend_groups` - Custom friend groups (Work, Family, Close Friends)
  - `task_visibility_rules` - Control which categories are public/hidden
  - `default_group_visibility` - full_access | public_tasks_only | busy_only

**Helper Functions:**
- `should_show_dashboard_today(user_id)` - Checks if first load
- `mark_dashboard_viewed(user_id)` - Updates session tracking
- `get_user_friend_groups(user_id)` - Fetches friend groups

### 2. TypeScript Types
**File:** `types/dashboard.ts`

**Key Interfaces:**
- `DashboardNotification` - Notification structure with priority levels
- `DashboardStats` - Today's stats (loops planned, friends active, recommendations)
- `FriendActivity` - Friend loop activity with privacy controls
- `FeaturedItem` - Venues, movies, events to highlight
- `TaskLocation` - Today's tasks for Loop map
- `PrivacySettings` - Extended privacy controls
- `DashboardData` - Complete dashboard response

### 3. Backend Service
**File:** `services/dashboard-aggregator.ts`

**Functions:**
- `fetchDashboardData(userId)` - Fetches complete dashboard data in parallel
- `fetchDashboardStats(userId)` - Aggregates today's loops, friends, recommendations
- `fetchFriendsActivity(userId)` - Respects privacy settings
- `fetchTodayTasks(userId)` - Gets tasks for Loop map
- `markDashboardViewed(userId)` - Session tracking
- `dismissNotification(notificationId)` - Remove notifications
- `getUnreadNotificationCount(userId)` - Badge count

**Performance:**
- Parallel data fetching using `Promise.all()`
- PostGIS spatial queries for location-based features
- Privacy filtering at database level

### 4. First-Load Detection
**File:** `utils/dashboard-tracker.ts`

**AsyncStorage Keys:**
- `@loop/last_dashboard_view` - Last view timestamp
- `@loop/dashboard_dismissed_today` - Dismissal tracking

**Functions:**
- `isFirstLoadToday()` - Check if first load
- `shouldShowDashboardNow()` - Combined check (first load AND not dismissed)
- `markDashboardViewedToday()` - Update local storage
- `markDashboardDismissedToday()` - Track dismissal
- `resetDashboardState()` - For testing/debugging

### 5. Dashboard Modal Component
**File:** `components/daily-dashboard-modal.tsx`

**Features:**
- Full-screen modal with slide animation
- **Two-view toggle:**
  1. **Stats View** - Card-based stats, notifications, friend activity
  2. **Loop Map View** - Embedded loop-map-view.tsx showing today's tasks

**Stats Cards:**
- Loops Planned (with stop count)
- Friends on Loops (with count)
- New Recommendations (count)
- Pending Invites (if any)

**Notification Cards:**
- Priority-based coloring (urgent=pink, attention=orange, info=blue)
- Priority bar on left edge
- Actionable buttons
- Dismissible with X button

**Friend Activity Feed:**
- Shows friends' public activities (loops, events, recommendations)
- Respects privacy settings
- Displays friend name, activity type, location

**Loading States:**
- Skeleton loaders
- Spinner with "Loading your day..."
- Empty states with icons

### 6. Enhanced Loop Header
**File:** `components/loop-header.tsx`

**New Features:**
- **Swipe-down gesture** using `react-native-gesture-handler`
  - Dampened drag effect (0.5x translation)
  - Triggers dashboard if swiped >50px or velocity >800
  - Spring animation reset
- **Notification badge**
  - Red circular badge with count
  - Shows "9+" for 10+ notifications
  - Positioned top-right of logo
- **Swipe hint**
  - Small chevron-down icon below logo
  - Subtle hint for discoverability

**Props Added:**
- `onDashboardOpen?: () => void` - Callback for swipe gesture
- `notificationCount?: number` - Badge count

### 7. Feed Screen Integration
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

**Dashboard State:**
```typescript
const [showDashboard, setShowDashboard] = useState(false);
const [isFirstLoadToday, setIsFirstLoadToday] = useState(false);
const [notificationCount, setNotificationCount] = useState(0);
```

**Lifecycle:**
1. On mount: `checkDashboardStatus()` checks first-load and notification count
2. If first load today: Show dashboard automatically
3. On close: Mark as dismissed, refresh notification count
4. Swipe-down: Re-open dashboard anytime

**LoopHeader Props:**
```typescript
<LoopHeader
  onDashboardOpen={handleDashboardOpen}
  notificationCount={notificationCount}
/>
```

**Dashboard Modal:**
```typescript
<DailyDashboardModal
  visible={showDashboard}
  onClose={handleDashboardClose}
  isFirstLoadToday={isFirstLoadToday}
/>
```

## üîß How It Works

### First Load Flow:
1. User opens app for first time today
2. `shouldShowDashboardNow()` checks AsyncStorage + database
3. If first load ‚Üí `isFirstLoadToday = true`, `showDashboard = true`
4. Dashboard appears as full-screen modal
5. User views stats, friend activity, Loop map
6. User dismisses dashboard
7. `markDashboardDismissedToday()` called ‚Üí Won't show again until tomorrow

### Swipe-Down Flow:
1. User swipes down from Loop logo (after first dismissal)
2. `panGesture` detects downward drag
3. Logo translates down with dampening effect
4. If drag >50px or velocity >800 ‚Üí `handleDashboardOpen()`
5. Dashboard opens as modal
6. User can toggle between Stats and Loop Map views
7. User closes dashboard ‚Üí Returns to feed

### Notification Badge Flow:
1. `getUnreadNotificationCount()` fetches count from database
2. Badge appears on Loop logo if count > 0
3. Shows actual count (1-9) or "9+" for 10+
4. When user opens dashboard ‚Üí Notifications marked as read
5. Badge refreshes on dashboard close

## üìä Dashboard Stats Logic

### Loops Planned Count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM calendar_events
WHERE user_id = $1
  AND status = 'scheduled'
  AND start_time >= $today
  AND start_time < $tomorrow
```

### Friends Active Count:
1. Fetch friend_activity_log for today (WHERE is_public = true)
2. Join with friendships table
3. Filter to only accepted friends
4. Count unique friends

### New Recommendations Count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recommendations
WHERE user_id = $1
  AND status = 'pending'
  AND created_at >= $yesterday
```

### Pending Invites Count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM plan_participants
WHERE user_id = $1
  AND rsvp_status = 'invited'
```

## üîê Privacy Controls (Foundation)

**Implemented:**
- Database schema for friend groups (Work, Family, Close Friends)
- Task visibility rules (hidden_categories vs public_categories)
- Default visibility levels (full_access, public_tasks_only, busy_only)
- Friend activity filtering based on is_public flag

**To Be Built (Phase 2):**
- UI for creating/editing friend groups
- Privacy settings modal for configuring visibility
- Group-specific recommendations (as requested by user)
- Distance-based group subscriptions
- Group messaging
- Direct messaging

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: First Load Today
1. **Reset dashboard state:** Call `resetDashboardState()` from utils
2. **Open app:** Launch Loop app
3. **Verify:** Dashboard appears automatically as full-screen modal
4. **Check header:** "What's happening today"
5. **Verify stats:** Should show 0 loops, 0 friends, etc. (if no data)
6. **Dismiss:** Close dashboard
7. **Reopen app:** Dashboard should NOT appear again (marked as dismissed)

### Test 2: Swipe-Down Gesture
1. **After dismissing:** Dashboard closed, on feed screen
2. **Swipe down from logo:** Place finger on Loop logo, drag down slowly
3. **Verify:** Logo translates down with dampening effect
4. **Release:** Dashboard should open if dragged far enough
5. **Try fast swipe:** Quick downward flick should also trigger
6. **Verify header:** "Your Dashboard" (not "What's happening today")

### Test 3: View Toggle
1. **Open dashboard** (via swipe-down)
2. **Default view:** Should be "Stats" view
3. **Tap "Loop Map":** Should switch to map view
4. **Verify map:** If tasks exist, should show pins + route
5. **Verify empty state:** If no tasks, should show "No loops planned" message
6. **Tap "Stats":** Should switch back to stats view

### Test 4: Notification Badge
1. **Create test notification:** Insert into dashboard_notifications table
2. **Reopen app:** Badge should appear on logo with count
3. **Open dashboard:** View notifications
4. **Close dashboard:** Badge should refresh (count may decrease if dismissed)

### Test 5: Stats Accuracy
1. **Add calendar event:** Create task for today
2. **Refresh dashboard:** Loops Planned should show 1
3. **Verify Loop Map:** Task should appear on map
4. **Add recommendation:** Create pending recommendation
5. **Refresh:** New Recommendations should show 1

### Test 6: Friend Activity (when data exists)
1. **Create friend activity:** Insert into friend_activity_log
2. **Ensure is_public = true**
3. **Refresh dashboard:** Friend should appear in activity feed
4. **Verify privacy:** Only public activities visible

- Equal-distance optimization (midpoint suggestions)
- Styled badges for group recommendations in feed

### 3. Messaging System
- Group messaging within subscribed groups
- Direct messaging between friends
- Database tables: `messages`, `conversations`, `conversation_participants`
- Real-time updates with Supabase Realtime

### 4. Smart Notifications
- Push notifications for group opt-ins
- "3 of 5 friends accepted group lunch suggestion"
- Notifications when friends opt-in to encourage participation
- Urgent re-prompts for time-sensitive items

### 5. Featured Items
- New music venues nearby (Google Places API + category filter)
- Movie releases user might like (TMDb API integration)
- Local events (Eventbrite API)
- Contextual suggestions (family in town, lunch with nearby friends)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **No Push Notifications Yet**
   - Need to install expo-notifications
   - Set up push token registration
   - Configure notification handling

2. **Featured Items Empty**
   - `fetchFeaturedItems()` currently returns empty array
   - Need to integrate external APIs (TMDb, Eventbrite)

3. **Friend Activity Requires Data**
   - Won't show activity unless friend_activity_log populated
   - Need to log activities when users complete tasks

4. **Map View Web Support**
   - react-native-maps doesn't work on web
   - Shows fallback message (as designed)

5. **Demo User Support**
   - Dashboard works with demo user but needs seed data
   - Add demo notifications, friend activities, tasks

## üí° Design Decisions

### Why Hybrid Modal (Full-Screen First, Swipe-Down Later)?
- **First load:** Users need to see daily overview prominently
- **Later access:** Swipe-down is faster than navigating to tab
- **Non-intrusive:** After dismissal, doesn't interrupt workflow
- **Snapchat-style:** Familiar gesture pattern

### Why Two Views (Stats vs Map)?
- **Stats:** Quick glance at numbers, notifications
- **Map:** Visual spatial awareness of day's loop
- **Toggle:** Fast switching without navigation
- **Calendar integration:** Map also accessible from calendar screen

### Why AsyncStorage + Database?
- **AsyncStorage:** Fast local check, works offline
- **Database:** Server-side truth, cross-device sync
- **Hybrid:** AsyncStorage for immediate response, database for accuracy

### Why Notification Badge on Logo?
- **Central location:** Logo is center of header
- **Always visible:** Every screen has Loop header
- **Subtle prompt:** Encourages swipe-down discovery
- **Standard pattern:** iOS/Android use badge indicators

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Parallel Data Fetching:
```typescript
const [stats, notifications, tasks, home, shouldShow] = await Promise.all([
  fetchDashboardStats(userId),
  fetchDashboardNotifications(userId),
  fetchTodayTasks(userId),
  fetchHomeLocation(userId),
  shouldShowFirstLoad(userId),
]);
```

### Database Optimizations:
- PostGIS spatial indexes on location fields
- Compound indexes on (user_id, created_at DESC)
- Dashboard stats cache table (pre-computed)
- RLS policies for security + performance

### Component Optimizations:
- Lazy loading of map view (only when toggled)
- ScrollView with minimal re-renders
- Animated.View for gesture handler (runs on UI thread)

---

## üé® UI/UX Highlights

### Visual Design:
- **Gradient stat cards** - Color-coded by metric type
- **Priority-based notification colors** - Urgent=pink, attention=orange, info=blue
- **Icon-driven** - Every stat has SF Symbol icon
- **Loading skeletons** - Smooth perceived performance
- **Empty states** - Helpful messages when no data

### Animations:
- **Modal slide-in** - Smooth presentation
- **Logo drag** - Dampened swipe gesture
- **Spring resets** - Natural bounce back
- **View toggle fade** - Subtle transitions

### Haptics:
- **Medium impact** - Dashboard open
- **Light impact** - View toggle, logo tap
- **Success notification** - Notification dismissed

### Accessibility:
- **Hit slop** - Larger touch targets (8pt padding)
- **Color contrast** - WCAG AA compliant
- **Icon + text** - Never icon-only
- **Screen reader support** - Semantic labels
