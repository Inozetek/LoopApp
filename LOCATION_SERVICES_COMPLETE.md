## üîß How It Works

### Permission Flow

**1. First App Launch:**
```
User opens app
  ‚Üì
Check permission status
  ‚Üì (if undetermined)
Request location permission
  ‚Üì
iOS: System dialog with your custom message
Android: System permission dialog
  ‚Üì
User grants/denies
  ‚Üì (if granted)
Get GPS location
  ‚Üì
Use for recommendations
  ‚Üì (if denied)
Use Dallas fallback location
```

**Permission Messages (User Sees):**
- **iOS:** "Loop needs your location to show nearby activities and calculate distances."
- **Android:** Same message in system dialog

---

### Location Retrieval

**Caching Strategy:**
- Location cached for 5 minutes
- Subsequent requests use cache (fast!)
- Cache clears after 5 min or manual clear
- Reduces battery drain
- Improves performance

**Accuracy Mode:**
- Uses "Balanced" accuracy
- Good enough for recommendations
- Doesn't drain battery
- Accurate within ~100 meters

**Fallback Location:**
- If permission denied ‚Üí Dallas, TX
- If GPS unavailable ‚Üí Dallas, TX
- If error occurs ‚Üí Dallas, TX
- **Coordinates:** 32.7767, -96.797

---

### Distance Calculations

**Haversine Formula:**
- Calculates great-circle distance
- Accurate for Earth's curvature
- Returns distance in miles
- Rounded to 1 decimal place

**Example:**
```typescript
// Calculate distance from user to activity
const distance = calculateDistance(
  userLat, userLon,
  activityLat, activityLon
);
// Returns: 2.3 (miles)
```

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### Core Functions

**1. requestLocationPermissions()**
- Requests foreground location permission
- Shows helpful message if denied
- Platform-specific instructions (iOS/Android)
- Returns true/false

**2. getCurrentLocation()**
- Gets user's current GPS location
- Uses cache if available (< 5 min old)
- Falls back to Dallas if denied
- Optionally gets city/state (reverse geocoding)
- Returns: `{ latitude, longitude, accuracy, city, state }`

**3. calculateDistance()**
- Haversine formula
- Calculates miles between two points
- Fast and accurate
- Returns: `number` (miles, 1 decimal)

**4. isWithinDistance()**
- Check if within X miles
- Useful for filtering
- Returns: `boolean`

**5. sortByDistance()**
- Sort activities by distance
- Closest first
- Returns: sorted array

**6. formatDistance()**
- Formats miles for display
- "< 0.1 mi" ‚Üí "Nearby"
- "< 1 mi" ‚Üí "2,640 ft"
- ">= 1 mi" ‚Üí "2.3 mi"

**7. estimateTravelTime()**
- Rough estimate based on 15 mph avg
- "< 0.5 mi" ‚Üí "< 5 min"
- "2 mi" ‚Üí "~8 min"
- "10 mi" ‚Üí "~40 min"

**8. watchLocation()** (Advanced)
- Real-time location updates
- Updates every 30 sec or 100 meters
- For Phase 2 features (commute tracking)
- Returns subscription (must call .remove())

**9. clearLocationCache()**
- Force refresh location
- Next call will fetch new GPS
- Useful for "Refresh location" button

**10. getLocationPermissionStatus()**
- Check status without requesting
- Returns: 'granted' | 'denied' | 'undetermined'
- Useful for UI decisions

## üìä What Changed in Recommendations

### Before (Mock Location):
```
User opens "For You" tab
  ‚Üì
Use Dallas coordinates (hardcoded)
  ‚Üì
Show mock activities (same 25 every time)
  ‚Üì
Distances are fake
```

### After (Real Location):
```
User opens "For You" tab
  ‚Üì
Request location permission (if needed)
  ‚Üì
Get GPS location
  ‚Üì
Fetch activities near GPS location
  ‚Üì
Calculate REAL distances
  ‚Üì
Sort by distance
  ‚Üì
Show personalized recommendations
```

## üéØ Impact on App

### Recommendation Feed
- ‚úÖ Uses real GPS location
- ‚úÖ Calculates actual distances
- ‚úÖ Shows "2.3 mi away" (real distance!)
- ‚úÖ Prioritizes nearby activities
- ‚úÖ Falls back gracefully if denied

### Location Scoring (in Recommendation Engine)
**Score breakdown:**
- On commute route: +20 points
- Near home/work (< 1 mi): +15 points
- Within preferred distance (2-5 mi): +10 points
- Too far: 0 points (still shown)

**Now uses REAL distance calculations!**

### Google Places API Integration
- If you add API key: Fetches real activities near GPS location
- If no API key: Uses mock data but with real distances
- Radius: 5 miles (8km) from your location

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Permission Request (First Launch)

**Steps:**
1. Fresh install or clear app data
2. Open app
3. Go to "For You" tab

**Expected:**
- iOS: System alert with custom message
- Android: Permission dialog
- Console: "‚úÖ Location permission granted" or "‚ö†Ô∏è denied"

---

### Test 2: Real Location Used

**Steps:**
1. Grant location permission
2. Pull down to refresh on "For You" tab
3. Check console logs

**Expected Console Output:**
```
üìç Using location: 32.7767, -96.7970
üìç Found 25 activities
‚ú® Generated 25 recommendations for [Your Name]
```

**Expected UI:**
- Activities show distances (e.g., "2.3 mi")
- Distances change if you move to different location
- Closest activities ranked higher

---

### Test 3: Permission Denied (Fallback)

**Steps:**
1. Deny location permission
2. App should still work

**Expected:**
- Console: "üìç Using fallback location (Dallas)"
- App shows activities near Dallas
- Distances based on Dallas coordinates
- No crashes or errors

---

### Test 4: Location Caching

**Steps:**
1. Open "For You" tab (gets location)
2. Pull down to refresh immediately
3. Check console logs

**Expected:**
- First load: "üìç Fetching current GPS location..."
- Second load (< 5 min): "üìç Using cached location"
- Faster performance on cached requests

---

### Test 5: Different Locations

**If you can move physically:**
1. Note current activities and distances
2. Move 1+ mile away
3. Pull down to refresh
4. Verify distances updated

**Expected:**
- Distances change based on new location
- Nearby activities change
- Recommendations re-rank

---

## üîê Privacy & Security

### Scenario 2: GPS Unavailable
**Handling:**
- Try/catch around GPS calls
- Falls back to Dallas
- Logs error to console
- User never sees error

### Scenario 3: Location Services Disabled
**Handling:**
- Check permission status first
- Don't request if disabled
- Use fallback location
- Show optional "Enable Location" prompt

### Scenario 4: Timeout
**Handling:**
- GPS has reasonable timeout
- Uses cache if available
- Falls back to last known location
- Doesn't hang indefinitely
