# Loop 2.0: Social Discovery Platform - Vision & Roadmap

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** Vision Planning & Phase 1 Implementation

---

## 🎯 Core Insight

**Current Problem:** Loop is a smart recommendation engine but lacks the engagement hooks that keep users coming back daily.

**The Pivot:** Transform Loop from "calendar app with recommendations" → **Instagram for real-life experiences**

**Key Philosophy:** Blend algorithmic intelligence with visual storytelling, social validation, and FOMO-driven content.

---

## 🌟 Vision Statement

**Loop 2.0 is a social discovery platform where:**
- Businesses create beautiful, engaging content (like Instagram posts)
- AI serves the right content to the right people at the right time
- Friends share what they're doing, creating social proof and FOMO
- Every recommendation can be added to your calendar in one tap
- The feed is so engaging you can't stop scrolling

**Target User Behavior:**
- Opens Loop 3-5x per day (like Instagram)
- Scrolls through feed for 5-10 minutes per session
- Adds 2-3 activities to calendar per week
- Shares recommendations with friends regularly
- Posts their own experiences occasionally

---

## 🏗️ Three-Pillar Architecture

### Pillar 1: Content-Rich Recommendations (Instagram-style)
**What:** Businesses & venues create visual posts with images/videos
**Examples:**
- Movie theater posts upcoming movies with trailers + showtimes
- Gaylord Hotel posts ice sculpture event with photos + ticket link
- Restaurant posts new menu items with food photography
- Concert venue posts upcoming shows with artist videos

**User Experience:**
- Scroll through visually stunning cards
- Each card has large image/video, caption, and "Add to Loop" button
- Tap to see full details, more photos, reviews
- Share to friends or add to calendar

### Pillar 2: Algorithmic Intelligence (Loop's Secret Sauce)
**What:** AI decides which content to show each user based on:
- User interests (stated + inferred from behavior)
- Location & convenient times
- Friend activity (social proof)
- Past feedback (thumbs up/down)
- Trending content in user's area

**User Experience:**
- Every scroll feels personalized
- "How did Loop know I'd love this?" moments
- Scores visible but not primary focus
- Content gets smarter over time

### Pillar 3: Social Discovery (Friend Activity)
**What:** See what friends are doing, planning, or recommending
**Examples:**
- "Sarah added brunch at Tartine to her Loop for Sunday 11am"
- "Mike is going to the Mavs game tonight - join him?"
- "Emma loved this coffee shop (photo of her there)"

**User Experience:**
- Blend of algorithmic recommendations + friend activity
- FOMO: "3 of your friends are going to this event"
- One-tap to join friend's plans
- Privacy controls for what you share

---

## 📱 Feed Architecture: Blended Content Model

### Content Types in Feed:

1. **Business Posts (Sponsored & Organic)**
   - Large image/video (Instagram-style)
   - Caption with hashtags
   - "Sponsored" badge if paid
   - CTA: "Add to Loop" or "Get Tickets"

2. **Algorithmic Recommendations (Current System)**
   - Data-dense cards with scores
   - Used when no business content available
   - OR: Redesign these to be more visual too

3. **Friend Activity**
   - "Sarah added this to her Loop"
   - Small profile pic + action + preview image
   - CTA: "Add to your Loop too"

4. **Events & Happenings**
   - Local events, concerts, festivals
   - Pulled from Eventbrite, local event APIs
   - Time-sensitive ("Starts in 2 hours!")

5. **Trending Near You**
   - "5 people went here this week"
   - Social proof without revealing identities
   - Popularity-based recommendations

### Feed Blending Strategy:

**Option A: Single Unified Feed**
- Mix all content types
- Algorithm determines order
- Feels like Instagram: variety keeps it fresh

**Option B: Two Tabs**
- **"For You" tab:** Algorithmic recommendations + business posts
- **"Around Me" tab:** Events, friend activity, trending

**Recommendation: Start with Option A, add Option B if users want more control**

## 🎨 Design Principles (Instagram-Inspired)

### Visual Hierarchy:
1. **Image/Video First** - Takes 60-70% of card
2. **Content Second** - Caption, venue name, details
3. **Action Third** - Add to Loop button, share, etc.

### Card Redesign Concepts:

**Concept 1: Instagram Story-style Cards**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   [Large Image/Video]   │
│                         │
│                         │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ 📍 Venue Name           │
│ "Amazing rooftop bar    │
│  with sunset views"     │
│                         │
│ [Add to Loop] [Share]   │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Concept 2: TikTok-style Full-Screen**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                         │
│   [Full-Screen Video]   │
│                         │
│  Overlay:               │
│  📍 Venue Name          │
│  ⭐ 4.8  💰 $$          │
│                         │
│  [❤️ Save] [➕ Add]     │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Concept 3: Hybrid (Recommended)**
- Large image (400px height)
- Score badge overlaid on top-right
- Venue name + short caption below
- Engagement buttons at bottom
- Swipe left to dismiss, right to save

### Brand Colors Update:

**Current Problem:** Using default blue (#0066FF)

**New Brand Palette (from pitch deck):**
```
Primary: #00BFFF (Neon Cyan Blue)
Secondary: #00FF9F (Neon Mint Green)
Accent: #7B68EE (Soft Purple)
Background: #0A0A14 (Deep Space Blue) - dark mode
Background: #F8F9FA (Soft White) - light mode
```

**Apply to:**
- "Add to Calendar" buttons → Neon Cyan
- Score badges → Gradient (Cyan → Mint)
- Selected calendar days → Neon Mint
- Tab bar active → Neon Cyan
- Action buttons → Neon Cyan/Mint gradient

## 🎯 Content Blending Strategy

### Problem to Solve:
**Not all recommendations will have business-created content. How do we blend content-rich posts with algorithmic recommendations seamlessly?**

### Solution: Three Card Styles

**Style 1: Business Post Card (Instagram-style)**
- Large image/video (400px height)
- Caption with hashtags
- Engagement metrics (views, adds)
- "Sponsored" or "Featured" badge if paid
- Use when: Business has created content

**Style 2: Enhanced Recommendation Card (Current + Photos)**
- Medium image (200px height) from Google Places
- Score badge + AI reasoning
- Metadata (rating, price, distance)
- No "sponsored" label (algorithmic)
- Use when: No business content but photos available

**Style 3: Data-Dense Card (Fallback)**
- No image or small icon
- Focus on score + reasoning
- Metadata prominent
- Use when: No photos available (rare with Google Places)

### Feed Algorithm:

```python
def generate_feed(user):
    feed = []

    # Get all potential items
    business_posts = fetch_business_posts(user.location, user.interests)
    algorithmic_recs = fetch_algorithmic_recommendations(user)
    friend_activity = fetch_friend_activity(user.friends)
    local_events = fetch_local_events(user.location)

    # Score each item (0-100)
    all_items = []
    for item in business_posts:
        score = calculate_business_post_score(item, user)
        all_items.append((item, score, 'business_post'))

    for item in algorithmic_recs:
        score = item.score.finalScore
        all_items.append((item, score, 'algorithm'))

    for item in friend_activity:
        score = calculate_social_score(item, user)
        all_items.append((item, score, 'friend'))

    for item in local_events:
        score = calculate_event_score(item, user)
        all_items.append((item, score, 'event'))

    # Sort by score
    all_items.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Apply diversity rules
    feed = apply_diversity_rules(all_items)

    # Limit sponsored content
    feed = limit_sponsored_ratio(feed, max_ratio=0.3)

    return feed[:20]  # Top 20 items

def apply_diversity_rules(items):
    """Ensure variety in feed"""
    feed = []
    last_types = []

    for item, score, type in items:
        # Don't show same type 3x in a row
        if last_types[-2:] == [type, type]:
            continue

        # Don't show same business twice
        if type == 'business_post' and item.business_id in [x.business_id for x in feed]:
            continue

        feed.append(item)
        last_types.append(type)

        if len(feed) >= 20:
            break

    return feed
```

### Visual Consistency:

**All cards share:**
- Same border radius (12px)
- Same shadow (subtle)
- Same action button style
- Same bottom padding
- Same animation (fade-in + slide-up)

**Cards differ:**
- Image size (large vs medium vs none)
- Badge style (sponsored vs score vs trending)
- Content density (caption vs AI reasoning)

**Result:** Feels cohesive but varied enough to stay interesting

## 🔔 World-Class Notifications Strategy

### Notification Types:

**1. Departure Alerts (High Priority)**
- "Time to leave for dinner at Tartine (traffic is heavy, leave now)"
- Smart timing: Adjust for real-time traffic
- Actionable: "Start Navigation" button

**2. Free Time Opportunities (Medium Priority)**
- "You have 2 hours free at 3pm today. Want suggestions?"
- Context-aware: Only during actual free time
- Actionable: "Show Recommendations" button

**3. Friend Activity (Medium Priority - Social FOMO)**
- "Sarah just added brunch at Blue Bottle tomorrow 10am. Join her?"
- Time-sensitive: Within 5 min of friend's action
- Actionable: "Add to My Loop" button

**4. Event Starting Soon (High Priority)**
- "Concert starts in 1 hour. Time to head out!"
- Only for events user added to calendar
- Actionable: "Start Navigation" + "Check-In"

**5. Trending Near You (Low Priority)**
- "5 people are at this coffee shop right now"
- Location-based: Only when user is nearby
- Actionable: "See Details" button

**6. Recommendation Freshness (Low Priority)**
- "New recommendations for you (3 new places nearby)"
- Daily digest: 9am or user's preferred time
- Actionable: "Open Loop" button

### Notification Timing Strategy:

**Rules:**
- Max 3 notifications per day (don't spam)
- Respect quiet hours (10pm-7am default)
- Batch low-priority notifications into daily digest
- High-priority notifications can override limits (departure alerts)
- User can customize notification preferences in settings

### Notification Settings:

**User Controls:**
```
Settings > Notifications

✓ Departure Alerts (30 min before)
✓ Friend Activity
✓ Event Reminders (1 hour before)
✓ Free Time Suggestions
  Trending Near You
  Daily Digest (9:00 AM)

Quiet Hours: 10:00 PM - 7:00 AM

Notification Frequency: Normal (max 3/day)
```

### Technical Implementation:

**iOS:**
- APNs (Apple Push Notification service)
- Rich notifications with images
- Notification actions (Add, Share, Dismiss)
- Notification grouping by type

**Android:**
- Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Notification channels by priority
- Custom notification sounds
- Notification actions

**Backend:**
- Notification queue system (Redis)
- Smart scheduling (don't send if user is active in app)

## 🤔 Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Feed Strategy:** Single unified feed vs two tabs ("For You" + "Around Me")?
   - Pro unified: Simpler UX, more engaging mix
   - Pro two tabs: User control, clearer separation

2. **Business Content Gating:** Should business posts be Premium-only or free for all?
   - Pro Premium-only: Monetization lever
   - Pro free for all: More engagement, network effects

3. **Score Visibility:** Hide, show, or on-tap?
   - Users love transparency but scores might reduce spontaneity
   - Could A/B test this

4. **Photo Access:** Google Places photos are free but limited. Pay for premium photos?
   - Free: Limited selection, not always high-quality
   - Paid (Google Places Premium): $40/1000 photo requests
   - Hybrid: Use free for now, upgrade to paid when revenue allows

5. **Social Privacy:** Default settings for friend activity visibility?
   - More sharing = more engagement but privacy concerns
   - Suggest: Opt-in for sharing, with granular controls

---

## 💡 Final Thoughts

This is ambitious but achievable. The key is to:

1. **Start with engagement:** Make the current feed more visually appealing (Phase 1)
2. **Add content layer:** Enable businesses to create posts (Phase 2)
3. **Add social layer:** Show friend activity (Phase 3)
4. **Scale with events:** Integrate local happenings (Phase 4)
5. **Perfect the calendar:** Make it world-class (Phase 5)
6. **Monetize:** Premium features + business subscriptions (Phase 6)

**The magic happens when all three pillars work together:**
- Beautiful content (Instagram)
- Smart recommendations (Loop)
- Social proof (friend activity)

If we execute this well, Loop becomes the platform people open every morning to plan their day and every evening to discover what to do tonight.

**Let's build this! 🚀**
