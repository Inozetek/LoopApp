## 💻 Technical Notes

### TypeScript Compilation
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# Output: No errors ✅
```

### Supabase Type Pattern
When updating the `users` table, use this pattern to avoid TypeScript errors:
```typescript
const { error } = await (supabase
  .from('users') as any)
  .update({ name, interests })
  .eq('id', userId);
```

### Running the App
```bash
npx expo start
```

Then:
- Press `i` for iOS simulator
- Press `a` for Android emulator
- Press `w` for web
- Scan QR code with Expo Go app for physical device
